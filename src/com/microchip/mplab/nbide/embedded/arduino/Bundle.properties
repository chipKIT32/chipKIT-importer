OpenIDE-Module-Display-Category=MPLAB IDE (Optional)
OpenIDE-Module-Long-Description=\
    <html>\nThis plugin contains an import wizard that can be launched from File->Import->Import Arduino Project. \n\
    The wizard will allow you to select a sketch file (*.ino) that was created in Arduino IDE. \n\
    Next, it will convert the sketch into an MPLAB X Makefile project. \n\
    With this project you will be able to build and debug the Arduino sketch in MPLAB X.\
    <br><br>A complete set of Help documentation is included. \
    Note that the wizard can import a project in two ways:<br>\n1) Copying all source code and libraries, in order to create a stand-alone MPLAB X project which is logically separate from the original (default mode) or<br>2) Retaining links to external source code and libraries that exist in the Arduino environment.\
    <br><br>The Arduino Import Plugin requires the following software to be installed: <br>- MPLAB X v4.10 or later<br>- Arduino IDE v1.81 or later<br>- Relevant toolchains configured in MPLAB X<br><br><br><br></html>
