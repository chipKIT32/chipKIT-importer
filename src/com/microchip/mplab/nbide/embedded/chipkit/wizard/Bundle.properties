    <h1>Project generation is complete<h1>\
    <p>Few tips to get you started quickly:</p>\
    <ul>\
        <li>Memory image can be programmed through the chipKIT bootloader by clicking the "cK" button</li>\
        (Some boards may require a hardware sequence to put it into bootloader mode)\
        <li>Most boards can also be programmed and debugged through supported debuggers connected to the ICSP pins</li>\
        <li>After debugging, bootloader must be reprogrammed in order to use bootloader interface</li>\
    </ul>\

    <h1>Project generation is complete<h1>\
    <p>Please note that the project has two configurations:</p>\
    <h3>"default" configuration</h3>\
    <ul>\
        <li>Memory image can be programmed through the chipKIT bootloader by clicking the "cK" button</li>\
        (Some boards may require a hardware sequence to put it into bootloader mode)\
        <li>Most boards can also be programmed and debugged through supported debuggers connected to the ICSP pins</li>\
        <li>After debugging, bootloader must be reprogrammed in order to use bootloader interface</li>\
    </ul>\
    <h3>"debug" configuration</h3>\
    <ul>\
        <li>Normal bootloader is used when programming (not debugging) through ICSP</li>\
        <li>Bootloader is replaced with a micro bootloader for debugging purposes</li>\
        <li>After debugging, bootloader must be reprogrammed in order to use bootloader interface</li>\
        This can be done through clicking the "Make and Program Device" button in MPLAB X IDE\
    </ul>\
